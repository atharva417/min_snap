# min_snap

fixed_time_ms.py is the implementation without optimal time segments

min_snap_time_opt.py is the implementation with optimal time segments, where gradient descent is implemented manually to find optimal time segments

constrained_time_opt.py is the implementation of optimal time segments with improved gradient descent using scipy library
